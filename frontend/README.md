Crystal and I worked in tandem all throughout this project so I would say the work completed reflects as much (i.e.
commit history in Gitlab). We began our capstone by referring to relevant past projects such as Kenziegram and MongoDB
App. After which we compared them with what we had mapped out in our capstone pitch, as we had extensively built out
what our file structure would look like. Once we had the foundations for the frontend and backend laid out, we moved
onto setting up the trello board tasks (color coded for each group member). What we made sure to do for each rubric
requirement was break down the steps so we need how to approach them head on. For example, for both the frontend and
backend dependencies, we made sure to add everything installed to our trello board so there was no confusion among group
members. This capstone overall taught me how to approach important tasks with efficiency and to always communicate with
group members on what was completed, what is next to do, what roadblocks appeared and what was proven successful.
